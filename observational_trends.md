Observational Trend Analysis

Your report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

1. The top five highest performing schools (succeeding in overall passing rate) were schools with lower count of students - Charter schools and the bottom five performing schools were schools with larger student counts - District schools. 

2. Charter schools have less of a per student budget compared to District schools. For example, Bailey High School, a District school, has a budget of $628 per student whereas Wilson High School, a Charter school, has a budget of $578 per student.

3. Larger school size and larger school spending doesnâ€™t represent higher overall passing rate. For example, Johnson High School with $3,094,650.00 student budget and a 4000 student count has a 73.64% overall passing rate and Pena High School with a $585,858.00 student budget and a 962 student count has a 95.27% overall passing rate.
